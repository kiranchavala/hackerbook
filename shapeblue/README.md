# ShapeBlue Internal Systems

## First Day

On your first day, work with the team to get access to Office365 (email,
calendar, sharepoint etc), Slack (communication), JIRA (bug tracking),
Confluence (wiki), ConnectWise (support, timesheets etc), Activity Timeline
(scheduling), BrickFTP (file sharing), and PagerDuty (support/paging). Share
your Github username with Rohit so you can be added to the github.com/shapeblue
organisation. Ask Paul/Dag to help create your Active Directory (AD) account
which will allow you access to SBLab, Jenkins, VPN etc.
