# ShapeBlue Internal Handbook

## First Day

On your first day, work with the team to get access to Office365 (email,
calendar, sharepoint etc), Slack (communication), JIRA (bug tracking),
Confluence (wiki), ConnectWise (support, timesheets etc), Activity Timeline
(scheduling), BrickFTP (file sharing), and PagerDuty (support/paging). Share
your Github username with Rohit so you can be added to the github.com/shapeblue
organisation. Ask Paul/Dag to help create your Active Directory (AD) account
which will allow you access to SBLab, Jenkins, VPN etc.

## Guidelines: Working Remotely

- Equip: Have an adequate internet connection and workstation for your job.
- Structure: Choose a quiet and distraction-free working space. If you're unable
  to work peacefully at home, get to a place where you can.
- Schedule: Set yourself working hours, maintain work-life balance.
- Communicate: Be open, responsive, friendly and helpful to your colleagues.
- Resolve: Avoid email if a discussion or argument escalates, get on a call with
  your colleagues.
- Accountability: Dedicate your full attention to job duties during working
  hours.
- Mastery: Learn often, learn fast, improve and be productive.
- Autonomy: Set clear expectations, manage your work with discipline and
  responsibility, take ownership. You break it, you fix it.
- Purpose: Explore your areas of interests, define short/long term goals that
  you desire.
