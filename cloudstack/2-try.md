# Test Drive

The best way to learn about CloudStack is to start as a user, learn how to setup
and install it and test drive its features.

Using [Virtual Machine Manager](https://virt-manager.org/), create a new VM
using [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) 18.04+ ISO with at least
30GB disk, 2-4 CPUs and 4-8GB RAM. Before starting the VM, go to the VM's
setting and tick `Copy host CPU configuration`. Start the VM and complete the
installation.

Next, find out the IP of the VM, ensure that you're able to SSH into the host.

Next, follow the following blog to install CloudStack with KVM in the VM:
