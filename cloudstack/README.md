Mentee responsibility:
- Go through the chapters one by one
- Watch video for sections of a chapter
- Follow and read recommended and reference articles (but don't go too deep)
- Watch the amount spent on chapters and hacking exercises against estimates
- Attempt to solve recommended exercises and challenges
- Send a brief update (email) to their mentor every work day, summarising what
  they completed, any issues/questions/blockers and what they will do next

Mentor responsibility:
- Mentor should review mentee's work and do daily short syncups and washups
- Follow daily logs and updates, answer questions and unblock early
- Mentor should update the [ShapeBlue Tracksheet](https://shapeblue.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TRAIN/pages/816381954/HackerBook+Tracksheet)
